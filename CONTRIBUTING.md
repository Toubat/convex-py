# Contributing

Contributions are welcome!

Please share any general questions, feature requests, or product feedback in our
[Convex Discord Community](https://convex.dev/community). We're particularly
excited to see what you build on Convex!

Run tests with

Convex is a fast moving project developed by a dedicated team. We are not
throwing code over the wall, nor are we expecting volunteers to do our job.
We'll do our best to be responsive to reviews and issues, but please bear with
us if things take a little time. For larger features, talk to us first and we'll
be happy to talk things through.
